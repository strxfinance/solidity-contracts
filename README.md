- STRX.FINANCE is a TRON Blockchain's liquid staking technology that unleashes TRX's real potential. Holders of TRX tokens can stake their tokens on the STRX.FINANCE platform to mint staked representation assets known as SFI. STRX.FINANCE freezes the underlying deposited TRX tokens with a group of Super Representatives.
- STRX.FINANCE also leases TRON Resources (Energy & Bandwidth) to customers in need, generating extra revenue for all SFI Holders. SFI, which represent the user's staked position, accumulate staking incentives in the background and may be used by users in DeFi to produce more income.
